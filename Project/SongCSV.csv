I am not going to make this a controversial entry because there was no controversy surrounding fatherhood for me. Sperm-donor is a label heard ever so often being used to refer to fathers, stemming from their absence in their child/children's life. It is quite appalling the number of fatherless homes that exist today. With this in mind, it gives us an even greater reason to celebrate those who are still here and those who left us in body but are still with us in spirit. They can teach those that left or were just never there, how to be a father.

There were good and bad moments but at the end of it all, there was always a lesson to be learnt. Whether these lessons were directly taught or were learnt from the mere presence of the experience, I cherish and hold every minute dear to my heart. Who I am today has largely been contributed to by the moments I shared with my father. One of the things that I have realized from my experience and from those of others is that men who grew up without the presence of a father, when given the opportunity, become great fathers. There are some men who think that if they cannot provide their child with material things then they cannot make any other contributions so it makes sense for them to leave. The reality of life is, a father being able to provide materially for a child is nowhere near half of the requirements of being a father, the major elements that are needed cannot be bought or even seen.
